The Colab session I worked in before GCP integration: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rd8VQm4-ksaqEI5rFdqmWha9cxPAZxwW?usp=sharing GCP base directory: /home/szabo_miklos_1998/hirkeresoscraper2 (on scrapermachine).

When looking at files here, be sure to look the latest ones in the directory tree (ie /home/szabo_miklos_1998/hirkeresoscraper2/2020/5/26/21/42_40). The latest scraping script we have: https://github.com/szabomikii/hirkeresoscrape2/blob/master/scraper_may26.py

Pestisrácok
Code dealt with 105 articles (105 hirkereso scrape, 105 pestisracok scrape), there are 2 files for which the scraping obviously didn't work (by 'obviously' I mean that even my script didn't think it has worked). pestisracok results Can check the files by going to the directory /home/szabo_miklos_1998/hirkeresoscraper2/2020/5/26/21/42_40/pestisracok, then cat */*.

Some examples:
The script produced the following result for this article result1 Seems fairly ok.

Another article.Result: psresult2 Also seems ok. Checked some other ones (5), those also seem ok. If we want higher confidence levels, can check more manually.

Origo, tv2
Scraping consistently doesn't work when run on GCP. Origo might be an easy fix (it did worked on Colab). For tv2, it should work in a large fraction of the cases (did in Colab), will look into it why it doesn't on GCP. Mokka tv and special cases still expected not to work. #checkthis1 origodoesntworkyet

888
Code doesn't detect any errors with scraping, it seems to work fine: 888seemstowork Checked 5 articles manually, those seemed ok.

Parsing
Two functions here: https://github.com/szabomikii/hirkeresoscrape2/blob/master/parsefunctions.py

We can get the names of different sections within a file (this list is often outlet-specific). We can also get the data stored under each keyword. The TEXT keyword doesn't work yet, but the TITLE does. #checkthis2. I think we'll be able to preceed with pipelining from here.

Example: parsing example

If we are really OOP fan, we could create classes for each article, with the author/title/text/etc data as attributes, but I don't really recommend it, since the last time I pursued this path, the need for better RAM management was clear after a few thousand objects created, which is hard (so I would stay with functional style).

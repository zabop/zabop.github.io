<h1 id="what-to-stargaze">What to stargaze</h1>
<p>Mostly copied from the CUAS email, naked eye stuff visible from Cambridge, updated this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mars is very well placed for observing. It is located in the southeast
in the early evening, and is directly due south around 11pm, about 50
degrees above the horizon, with 90 degrees being directly overhead.
It&#39;s hard to miss since apart from the moon it&#39;s the brightest object
visible in the sky, and has a striking orange colour.</p>
<p>If you are out earlier in the evening you may see Jupiter and Saturn.
They are both low in the southwest, setting around 8:30pm although
they will be harder to find after 7:30pm. Jupiter looks like a bright
yellow-white star, almost as bright as Mars. Saturn is about 10 moon
widths to the left and slightly above, and is much fainter, but still
bright enough to see from Cambridge. In general, planets can be
distinguished by their lack of twinkling, while stars do twickle.</p>
<p>For those of you lucky enough to have binoculars, you may also be able
to see the Andromeda Galaxy, the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules
and the Pleiades Open Cluster in Taurus. The easiest way to find these
will be to consult stellarium, a free (and very good) planetarium
software that shows you what&#39;s visible in the sky from your location.</p>

<p>This also can show you which one is Mars, if having trouble with that one. Other fun stuff: watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">ISS</a> passing by. Copied from <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_Kingdom&amp;region=England&amp;city=Cambridge#.X5s5DIieS00">here</a>:</p>

<p>Maybe some weeks later it&#39;ll be less dawnish (check back on the website). This will be extra fun on the 15th of November, that&#39;s when SpaceX&#39;s Crew-1 launches (<a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/">current schedule here</a>): there will be the ISS going over the sky, and another bright dot approaching it, and this bright dot will get closer and closer as the spaceship docks to the ISS. In December there will be Soyuz/Progress launches, I&#39;m not sure how much those are visible with naked eye though.</p>
<p>If the person we are talking to is not a physnatsci-oriented, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFxKZRyQt4">this is a story which sounds quite beautiful</a>. My other favourite story from that channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgnlkJPga4">this</a>, which is not factually related to stars, but I think it has a mood which mathces with stargazing. Late pleistocene parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind">Sapiens</a> is also quite matching.</p>
<p>Factual stuff doesn&#39;t really matter though. Yeah, it is hard to hold hands without holding hands, but try not to be lame, but don&#39;t be overly afraid of being lame, rather be lame then do nothing. That&#39;s gonna work :)</p>
